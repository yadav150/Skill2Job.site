<h2>Selection Process of RRB NTPC Vacancy</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
The selection for RRB NTPC posts involves multiple stages, including the 1st Stage Computer Based Test (CBT), 2nd Stage CBT, Typing Skill Test or Computer Based Aptitude Test (as applicable), followed by Document Verification and Medical Examination. Candidates are shortlisted strictly based on merit at each stage.
</p>

<h2>1st Stage Computer Based Test (CBT)</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
The 1st Stage CBT is a screening test. It consists of 100 objective-type questions to be completed in 90 minutes, with a total of 100 marks. Negative marking is applied at 1/3 mark for each wrong answer. The subjects include Mathematics, General Intelligence and Reasoning, and General Awareness. The questions are generally in conformity with the educational standards prescribed for the posts.
</p>
<p class="justify-p">
The normalized score of the 1st Stage CBT is used to shortlist candidates for the 2nd Stage CBT. Minimum eligibility percentages for various categories are UR-40%, EWS-40%, OBC (NCL)-30%, SC-30%, ST-25%, with a relaxation of 2 marks for PwBD candidates if required.
</p>

<h2>2nd Stage Computer Based Test (CBT)</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
Shortlisting for the 2nd Stage CBT is based on normalized marks from the 1st Stage CBT. The exam consists of 120 objective-type questions to be completed in 90 minutes, with a total of 120 marks and 1/3 negative marking for wrong answers. Subjects are the same as in the 1st Stage CBT.
</p>
<p class="justify-p">
Normalized marks from the 2nd Stage CBT are used to shortlist candidates either for Typing Skill Test/Computer Based Aptitude Test (for relevant posts) or directly for Document Verification for posts without these tests. Minimum eligibility percentages remain the same as the 1st Stage CBT.
</p>

<h2>Computer Based Aptitude Test (CBAT)</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
CBAT is conducted only for candidates applying for the Station Master post after qualifying the 2nd Stage CBT. Candidates must score a minimum T-Score of 42 in each test battery. Selection for CBAT is limited to eight times the number of vacancies for each community. Vision certificates must be submitted in the prescribed format, failing which candidates will not be allowed to appear.
</p>
<p class="justify-p">
Candidates must qualify in all CBAT test batteries. The test is available in English and Hindi only, and no negative marking is applied.
</p>

<h2>Typing Skill Test (TST)</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
TST is applicable for posts including Senior Clerk cum Typist, Junior Accounts Assistant cum Typist, and Account/Junior Clerk cum Typist. It is qualifying in nature, and marks are not added to merit. Candidates equal to eight times the number of vacancies are called for the test.
</p>
<p class="justify-p">
Candidates must type at least 30 WPM in English or 25 WPM in Hindi on a personal computer without editing tools or spell check. Hindi typing is available in Kruti Dev and Mangal fonts.
</p>

<h2>Document Verification (DV)</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
Candidates are called for Document Verification based on merit and the number of vacancies. Appointment is subject to passing a Medical Fitness Test, verification of educational and community certificates, and antecedents/character verification.
</p>
<p class="justify-p">
RRBs recommend the names of shortlisted candidates, but final appointment is offered only by the respective Railway Administrations.
