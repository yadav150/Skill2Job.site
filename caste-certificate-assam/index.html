Learn how to apply for a caste certificate online in Assam through Sewa Setu and e-District portals, eligibility criteria, required documents, application tracking, and verification details.
</p>
<h2>Make Caste Certificate Online in Assam</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
A caste certificate is an official document that certifies that an individual belongs to a particular caste, especially among the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), or Other Backward Classes (OBC) communities. In Assam, the caste certificate is essential for availing various government schemes, reservation benefits, educational admissions, and other welfare-related opportunities. The Government of Assam has made the process simple and accessible by enabling online applications through the official portals.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
In this article, we at <strong>Skill2Job</strong> aim to inform and guide users about the correct and lawful method to apply for a caste certificate online without depending on agents or middlemen who often charge unreasonably high fees for simple online procedures. Many individuals face unnecessary financial burden because of such practices at local desks or shops that exploit a lack of awareness. Our purpose is to empower citizens with accurate information so they can apply for government documents confidently, free of extra costs or unfair assistance.
</p>

<h2>Eligibility for Caste Certificate in Assam</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
To obtain a caste certificate in Assam, applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements set by the government. These criteria ensure that only individuals who genuinely belong to the declared caste category can access the benefits associated with caste certification. The certificate plays an important role in availing government schemes, educational reservations, and employment opportunities. Below are the specific eligibility requirements.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any permanent resident of Assam belonging to SC, ST (Plain), ST (Hills), or OBC/MOBC categories.</li>
  <li>The applicant must have valid proof of residence and caste.</li>
  <li>Supporting documents must show that the family has historically been recognized under the same caste category.</li>
  <li>The certificate is generally issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Sub-Divisional Officer, or Circle Officer of the respective district.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Eligibility for Caste Certificate in Assam</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
There are certain important eligibility criteria that must be satisfied in order to successfully obtain a caste certificate online in Assam. These criteria are issued and verified by the relevant authorities and play a crucial role in the application process. The main requirements are explained below:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The applicant‚Äôs parents must have resided in Assam for a significant period, generally more than 20 to 30 years. This must be proved through voter lists ‚Äî specifically the voter list of 2005 or older, and the most current voter list (for example, 2025). Both voter lists should clearly include the names of the parents, and there must be consistency in the details across these lists.</li>
  
  <li>It is now mandatory for applicants to possess a <strong>Recommendation Certificate</strong> issued by the competent authority. This recommendation is required for verification of caste and eligibility and must be obtained from the relevant departments such as: 
    <ul>
      <li>SC Welfare Department</li>
      <li>Backward Classes Department</li>
      <li>Any other authorised department in Assam related to caste verification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>The recommendation certificate plays a vital role in the caste certificate process, especially for SC, ST, and OBC categories, as it acts as an official confirmation of caste from recognised authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
Applicants should ensure that they have obtained and correctly uploaded the necessary recommendation certificate along with other required documents to avoid delays or rejection of their application. Meeting these important eligibility criteria is essential for a smooth and successful caste certificate application process.
</p>
<h2>Application Fee for Online Caste Certificate in Assam</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
The Government of Assam has made the process of applying for a caste certificate online cost-effective and transparent. For most applicants, the application fee is minimal or in some cases, completely free, depending on the category and the issuing authority. However, applicants should be aware of the applicable fees and payment methods before proceeding with the application to avoid delays or rejections.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
If applying through the <strong>Sewa Setu Portal</strong>, the total application fee is ‚Çπ40, which includes all charges for processing. This makes it the most economical option for citizens, in addition to being convenient and user-friendly. The Sewa Setu system is designed to provide a simple online process without hidden fees or extra charges.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
For applications through other methods, such as the e-District Assam portal, the application fee generally ranges from ‚Çπ50 to ‚Çπ100, depending on category and district-specific regulations. Certain categories, especially SC/ST applicants, may be exempted from the fee under specific welfare schemes. It is important to check the official portal or local authority for the exact amount applicable to your case.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
The fee for online caste certificate applications can usually be paid through secure online payment methods available on the application portal, such as net banking, debit/credit cards, or UPI. In some cases, payment may also be made at the designated government office when submitting or collecting the certificate offline.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Applicants should keep a copy of the payment receipt or transaction reference number for future reference. This proof of payment may be required during verification or while tracking the application status. It is recommended to make payments only through official channels to avoid fraud or unnecessary additional charges.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Understanding the fee structure beforehand ensures a smooth application process and helps avoid any last-minute issues. Always refer to the official Sewa Setu or e-District Assam portal for the most accurate and updated information regarding application fees.
</p>

<h2>Documents Required for Caste Certificate Assam</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
Before starting the online application process for a caste certificate in Assam, ensure that you have all the necessary documents ready in scanned format (PDF or JPEG). These documents are mandatory for successful submission and verification of your application.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applicant's Photograph (‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶¶‡¶®‡¶ï‡¶æ‡ß∞‡ßÄ‡ß∞ ‡¶´‡¶ü‡ßã) ‚Äî <strong>Mandatory</strong>.</li>
  <li>Proof of Date of Birth ‚Äî One of Birth Certificate, Aadhaar Card, PAN Card, or Admit Card issued by any recognized Board (<strong>Mandatory</strong>).</li>
  <li>Proof of Residence ‚Äî One of Permanent Resident Certificate, Aadhaar Card, EPIC (Voter ID), Land Document, Electricity Bill, or Ration Card of Applicant or Parent (<strong>Mandatory</strong>).</li>
  <li>Caste Certificate of Father (<strong>Mandatory</strong>).</li>
  <li>Recommendation from an authorised caste/tribe/community organisation notified by the State Government (<strong>Mandatory if father's caste certificate is not present</strong>).</li>
  <li>Any other supporting document ‚Äî Voter List, Affidavit, Existing Caste Certificate, etc. (<strong>Optional</strong>).</li>
  <li>Scanned Copy of the Application Form ‚Äî <strong>Mandatory if applying from PFC/CSC</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
Applicants must ensure that all uploaded documents are clear, complete, and in the correct format. Missing or unclear documents may result in delays, revert back requests, or rejection of the application. It is advised to cross-check all required documents before submission to ensure a smooth process.
</p>

<h2>How to Apply for Caste Certificate Online in Assam</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
There are two main methods to apply for a caste certificate online in Assam ‚Äî through the <strong>Sewa Setu Portal</strong> and the <strong>e-District Assam Portal</strong>. Among these, the Sewa Setu portal is the most convenient and recommended option for the general public. The e-District Assam portal is primarily intended for CSC (Common Service Centre) agents and requires login credentials that are difficult for ordinary citizens to obtain without prior approval from the Deputy Commissioner‚Äôs office.
</p>

<h3>Method 1: Apply Through Sewa Setu Portal (Recommended)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Visit the official Sewa Setu portal at <a href="https://sewasetu.assam.gov.in" target="_blank">https://sewasetu.assam.gov.in</a>.</li>
  <li>On the homepage, navigate to the ‚ÄúApply for Caste Certificate‚Äù section.</li>
  <li>Fill out the online form with accurate personal details, address, and caste category.</li>
  <li>Upload all required documents, including proof of identity, residence, and caste verification documents.</li>
  <li>Review the form carefully to ensure there are no mistakes.</li>
  <li>Submit the application and download the acknowledgment slip or reference number for tracking.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
The Sewa Setu portal is designed to be user-friendly and does not require prior registration or approval from district offices. Applicants can directly apply and track their application status using the reference number provided after submission. This method is efficient, cost-effective, and best suited for the general public.
</p>

<h3>Method 2: Apply Through e-District Assam Portal</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Visit the official e-District Assam portal at <a href="https://edistrict.assam.gov.in" target="_blank">https://edistrict.assam.gov.in</a>.</li>
  <li>Log in with your e-District credentials. If you do not have them, you must apply at your nearest Deputy Commissioner‚Äôs office.</li>
  <li>After logging in, search for ‚ÄúCaste Certificate‚Äù under available services and click ‚ÄúApply.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Fill in all necessary personal and caste-related details carefully.</li>
  <li>Upload scanned copies of all required documents.</li>
  <li>Submit your application and download the acknowledgment slip containing your reference number.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
While this method is officially available, it is less preferred for individual applicants because obtaining an e-District ID and password is not straightforward. It is mainly used by authorised CSC operators to apply on behalf of others.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Our recommendation for the general public is to apply through the <strong>Sewa Setu Portal</strong>. For this, we have created a detailed step-by-step section below that clearly explains how to apply for a caste certificate through Sewa Setu. Please proceed to the next section for a clear and comprehensive guide.
</p>
<h2>How to Apply for Caste Certificate Through Sewa Setu</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
Please follow the procedure carefully to successfully apply for a caste certificate through the Sewa Setu portal. This step-by-step guide will help you navigate the process without confusion or delay.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
1. First, proceed to the ‚ÄúImportant Section‚Äù on the Sewa Setu portal and check for ‚ÄúOnline Application for Caste Certificate.‚Äù Click on the ‚ÄúSewa Setu‚Äù link to open the official Sewa Setu website.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
2. If you are already registered on the Sewa Setu portal, there is no need to register again. If you are not registered, please follow the registration process first. <a href="https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb1sPWRCBtxA5KiCPr3e">Click Here to know Registration Process</a> for Sewa Setu.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
3. After registration or logging in, enter your credentials and log into your account. Once logged in, navigate to the application section. You will see a yellow button labeled ‚ÄúApply Now.‚Äù Click on it to start your application process.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
4. Fill in the application form carefully. All details must match the information provided in your supporting documents, especially your Aadhaar card and caste-related proofs. It is highly recommended to double-check all details before proceeding.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
5. After completing the form, proceed to the ‚ÄúUpload Documents‚Äù section. Here, you will be required to upload scanned copies of your documents, which include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address proof (Aadhaar card, voter ID, electricity bill, ration card, or land document).</li>
  <li>Passport-size photograph of the applicant.</li>
  <li>Caste-related documents.</li>
  <li>Recommendation certificate from the competent authority (if father‚Äôs caste certificate is not available).</li>
  <li>Proof of date of birth (Birth Certificate or Aadhaar card).</li>
  <li>Other supporting documents such as voter lists (one list from 2005 or earlier and another from the current year, e.g., 2025).</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
<strong>Note:</strong> If the applicant does not have a separate birth certificate, the Aadhaar card can be used as proof of both residence and date of birth.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
6. After uploading all the necessary documents, proceed to the payment page. Please note that the Sewa Setu portal may occasionally face network issues or temporary downtime. Do not press the back button; instead, wait until the page loads fully.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
7. Once loaded, select your payment gateway, such as Yes Bank, SBI, or others. You can pay easily through UPI, debit card, or net banking. UPI is recommended for convenience.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
8. After successful payment, you will receive a reference number. Do not press back during this process. Once completed, you will be automatically redirected to the homepage.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
9. To confirm your application, check the acknowledgment section in your application dashboard. Download and save the acknowledgment slip for future reference.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
10. You will receive a reference number that will be valid for both the Sewa Setu and e-District portals. Use this reference number to track your application status in the future.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Following this process carefully will ensure that your caste certificate application through Sewa Setu is smooth, complete, and free of errors. Always keep your documents and reference number safe for future use.
</p>
<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p class="justify-p">
Applicants must not forget to upload a scanned copy of the duly filled application form because if you forget to upload this, your application may be sent back for revision. To prevent this, you must upload the scanned copy of the filled application form with only relevant fields completed. Ensure that all inclusions are combined into a single PDF file. The application form is made available in the Important Weblinks section below for download.
</p>

<h2>How to Check Caste Certificate Application Status</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
Once the online application is submitted, the applicant can check the application status anytime using the reference number. The status can be tracked on both the Sewa Setu and e-District portals, depending on where the application was submitted.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit the same portal where you applied (either Sewa Setu or e-District Assam).</li>
  <li>Click on ‚ÄúTrack Application Status.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Enter your reference number or application ID and select your district.</li>
  <li>Click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù to view the current status of your application.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justify-p">
The system will display whether your application is under process, approved, rejected, or marked as revert back for correction. Once your application is approved, you can download the caste certificate directly from the same portal.
</p>

<h2>What After Successful Submission?</h2>

<p class="justify-p">
After successful submission of the online application through either the Sewa Setu or e-District Assam portal, applicants must wait for verification and approval by the concerned authorities. You can regularly monitor the status using your reference number, as both portals are linked and provide real-time updates on the progress.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
If your application shows the status ‚ÄúRevert Back,‚Äù it indicates that there is an issue with your submission, such as unclear or missing documents. In that case, log in to the same portal, open your application, and check the remarks. You can then upload the corrected or missing documents and resubmit the application for review.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Once the revised application is submitted, it will again be reviewed by the verification officer. If no revert back is shown, the application will continue processing. Generally, the caste certificate takes around three to four months to be approved, depending on the verification and workload of the respective office.
</p>

<p class="justify-p">
Upon approval, you may receive an SMS notification on your registered mobile number. However, if no message is received, applicants can manually check the status online. The caste certificate can then be downloaded in PDF format from the same portal once it is marked as approved.
